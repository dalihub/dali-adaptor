   * Algorithm:
   *
   * - For a point on the contour, draw a halfline in a direction
   *   (eg. decreasing x) to infinity,
   * - Count how many times it crosses all other contours,
   * - Pay special attention to points falling exactly on the halfline,
   *   specifically, they count as +.5 or -.5, depending the direction
   *   of crossing.
   *
   * All this counting is extremely tricky:
   *
   * - Floating point equality cannot be relied on here,
   * - Lots of arc analysis needed,
   * - Without having a point that we know falls /inside/ the contour,
   *   there are legitimate cases that we simply cannot handle using
   *   this algorithm.  For example, imagine the following glyph shape:
   *
   *         +---------+
   *         | +-----+ |
   *         |  \   /  |
   *         |   \ /   |
   *         +----o----+
   *
   *   If the glyph is defined as two outlines, and when analysing the
   *   inner outline we happen to pick the point denoted by 'o' for
   *   analysis, there simply is no way to differentiate this case from
   *   the following case:
   *
   *         +---------+
   *         |         |
   *         |         |
   *         |         |
   *         +----o----+
   *             / \
   *            /   \
   *           +-----+
   *
   *   However, in one, the triangle should be filled in, and in the other
   *   filled out.
   *
   *   One way to work around this may be to do the analysis for all endpoints
   *   on the outline and take majority.  But even that can fail in more
   *   extreme yet legitimate cases, such as this one:
   *
   *           +--+--+
   *           | / \ |
   *           |/   \|
   *           +     +
   *           |\   /|
   *           | \ / |
   *           +--o--+
   *
   *   The only correct algorithm I can think of requires a point that falls
   *   fully inside the outline.  While we can try finding such a point (not
   *   dissimilar to the winding algorithm), it's beyond what I'm willing to
   *   implement right now.
