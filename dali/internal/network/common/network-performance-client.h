/**
 *  @brief Network Performance client
 *
 *  Every time a client connects to Dali, a NetworkPerformanceClient object is created.
 *  It is responsible for processing incoming commands, and storing the client state
 *  (e.g. what performance markers it wants).
 *
 *  Certain commands such as dump-scene need to be run on the main Dali event thread.
 *  To achieve this, a trigger event is used which executes a function on the main thread.
 *  The sendDataInterface is then used with the client id to transmit the data to the client.
 *  The reason for using a client id is because the client
 *  can be deleted in between receiving a command and sending a response.
 *  E.g.
 *  NetworkPerformanceClient (own thread, id 5)  <---  Dump Scene Command
 *  delete NetworkPerformanceClient              <---  Connection closed
 *  MainThread. Send scene data to client 5. Client 5 has been deleted so don't send the data.
 *
