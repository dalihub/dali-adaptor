/**
 * @brief An Application class object should be created by every application
 * that wishes to use Dali.
 *
 * It provides a means for initializing the
 * resources required by the Dali::Core.
 *
 * The Application class emits several signals which the user can
 * connect to.  The user should not create any Dali objects in the main
 * function and instead should connect to the Init signal of the
 * Application and create the Dali objects in the connected callback.
 *
 * Applications should follow the example below:
 *
 * @code
 * class ExampleController: public ConnectionTracker
 * {
 * public:
 *   ExampleController( Application& application )
 *   : mApplication( application )
 *   {
 *     mApplication.InitSignal().Connect( this, &ExampleController::Create );
 *   }
 *
 *   void Create( Application& application )
 *   {
 *     // Create Dali components...
 *   }
 *  ...
 * private:
 *   Application& mApplication;
 * };
 *
 * int main (int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   Application app = Application::New(&argc, &argv);
 *   ExampleController example( app );
 *   app.MainLoop();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If required, you can also connect class member functions to a signal:
 *
 * @code
 * MyApplication app;
 * app.ResumeSignal().Connect(&app, &MyApplication::Resume);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class accepts command line arguments as well. The following options are supported:
 *
 * @code
 *  -w|--width          Stage Width
 *  -h|--height         Stage Height
 *  -d|--dpi            Emulated DPI
 *     --help           Help
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the above options are found, they are stripped from argv, and argc is updated appropriately.
